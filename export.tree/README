In this memory interference task, each trial began  
with a space key press, followed by a fixation dot   
for 1000–1500 ms. Then, two lateral objects appeared:
a cued target (learned) and an irrelevant novel one. 
Participants memorized the cued object.              
After a 1400 ms delay, interference objects appeared  
briefly on half the blocks; otherwise, only fixation.
A probe then showed two objects vertically aligned,  
and participants selected the target using arrow keys.
Feedback followed the response, showing the correct  
object with color-coded text for 1000 ms.
